Name three ways you can produce a sparse model. 7. Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference (i.e., making predictions on new instances)? What about MC Dropout? 8. Practice training a deep neural network on the CIFAR10 image dataset: a. Build a DNN with 20 hidden layers of 100 neurons each (that’s too many, but it’s the point of this exercise). Use He initialization and the ELU activation function. b. Using Nadam optimization and early stopping, train the network on the CIFAR10 dataset. You can load it with keras.datasets.cifar10.load_​data(). The dataset is composed of 60,000 32 × 32–pixel color images (50,000 for training, 10,000 for testing) with 10 classes, so you’ll need a softmax output layer with 10 neurons.

    "\n",
    "2. Is it OK to initialize the bias terms to 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes, it is generally acceptable to initialize the bias terms to 0. However, it is important to note that other values may result in better performance, depending on the type of model and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Name three advantages of the SELU activation function over ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELU is self-normalizing, meaning it does not suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELU has a higher mean and variance than ReLU, which can help to reduce internal covariate shift and can lead to faster training.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELU is more robust to outliers and can maintain better performance under noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In which cases would you want to use each of the following activation functions: SELU, leaky ReLU (and its variants), ReLU, tanh, logistic, and softmax?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELU: When training deep neural networks and when dealing with noisy data or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaky ReLU (and its variants): When training deep neural networks and when dealing with data that is not linearly separable.\n",

    "Tanh: When training shallow neural networks and when dealing with data that is non-linear.\n",

    "Logistic: When training shallow neural networks and when dealing with binary classification tasks.\n",

    "Softmax: When training shallow neural networks and when dealing with multi-class classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What may happen if you set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: If the momentum hyperparameter is set too close to 1, the SGD optimizer may cause oscillations in the optimization trajectory and can lead to slow convergence or even divergence of the optimization process. This is because the SGD optimizer will attempt to move too quickly in the direction of the previous update, resulting in overshooting the optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name three ways you can produce a sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use L1 regularization, which adds a penalty on the sum of the absolute values of the weights in the model. This encourages the model to reduce the number of non-zero weights, leading to a sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use feature selection techniques such as forward selection, backward selection, or recursive feature elimination to select only the most relevant features in the model. This can reduce the number of inputs, leading to a sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pruning techniques such as magnitude pruning or low-rank factorization to remove redundant weights from the model. This can lead to a more efficient and sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference (i.e., making predictions on new instances)? What about MC Dropout?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Dropout does slow down training, as it requires more iterations for the model to converge. However, it does not slow down inference, as the dropout layers are usually not used during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "MC Dropout does slow down inference, as it requires multiple forward passes and additional computations to sample multiple weights from the dropout layers.\n",
